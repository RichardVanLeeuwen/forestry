# Forestry
Git worktrees made easy!

## Why worktrees?
Git worktrees allow you to have multiple branches of the same repository next to eachother.
Usually people use git stashes when they have to temporarily switch between branches without committing (for instance when you get a call from a colleague and you want to search through their code to help them out). I ended up losing track of my stashes, somehow losing them or forgetting I had a stash and doing the same work again. With worktrees I now can just make a new worktree to help a colleague and my work is left exactly as it was. I can leave my work as is while checking if a bug is also in main. I can start a build & deploy cycle and start work on another branch while waiting for it to finish.
Git worktrees quickly became my favorite git function!

## Why forestry?
I'm decently skilled with the terminal, but not everyone is. Forestry is an attempt to make the power of worktrees more accessible to people who don't live in the terminal.
